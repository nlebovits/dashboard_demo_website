#### Philadelphia has a gun violence problem. This dashboard aims to help solve it.
\
Below, you can view every single vacant or abandoned property in Philadelphia. Users can search, zoom, filter, and export data. Every property is listed along with ownership data, the importance of intervention based on gun crime rates ("priority level"), how the property can be legally acquired, and other relevant info such as price and the relevant RCO. 

Click elsewhere on the website to learn about [why this exists](about), [how it was built](more_info), and [what you can do with it](take_action).
