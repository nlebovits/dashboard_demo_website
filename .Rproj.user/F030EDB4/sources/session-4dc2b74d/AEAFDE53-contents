title: "How We Built It"

Based on those conversations, I developed a Python script that classified every vacant property in
the City based on priority level and acquisiton process. Priority level was estimated based on the
surrounding rate of gun crime and the relative lack of tree canopy cover. One major challenge in
this presentation was explaining the concept of a Python script to a non-coder audience; it required
me to think creatively about how to represent code in a more intuitive graphic form.

I used a decision tree to suggest the most relevant
legal process necessary to intervene in every single
property in Philadelphia. Because it deals with
sophisticated legal processes, this decision tree is far
from final. However, it is a good starting point, and I
am in the process of getting further input from
organizations and agencies like the Garden Justice
Legal Initiative and the Philadelphia Land Bank.
